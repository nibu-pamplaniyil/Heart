## 🩺 About

The **Heart** project uses a trained machine learning model to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.  
It utilizes health-related data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate to provide a risk assessment.  
The model was trained and evaluated using standard machine learning algorithms and is integrated into a simple Python-based interface.
